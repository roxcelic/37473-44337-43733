This is a python encoding and encryption software
it originally started out as a joke of being bored of binarys 2-bit system so I decided to make my own using a 3-bit system with the characters 3,4 and 7

to run this you simply run the file titled 'index.py'

once this script is running you can do a few things, those being:

encode(e) - this allows the user to turn a string of ASCII characters into my 3-bit system

decode(d) - this allows the user to turn a string of my 3-bit encoding system into ASCII characters

encrypt(ec) - this allows the user to encrypt a string of my 3-bit encoding system it will provide the output and the key using the print function (it will label them both)

decrypt(dc) - providing you have the string of encrypted code and the key you can input both and it will decode it for you

access_file(af)-(o) - using the /input/ folder, you can place a file into it, run the access_file(af) command then the open file command(o) and type in the file name (including extension) and it will save the file data into the 'output' variable which it gives you the ability to call data from when using any command which requires an input (bar in menu commands, file names and keyd data)

access_file(af)-(w) - when using the access_file(af) command and then the write command(w) it will check if you have any data in the 'output' variable and then it will write this to a file into the /output/ folder with the name it will ask for you to provide (including file extension)

stop(stop) - stop ends the script

this may be recieving more updates as I learn how to use python better and i understand more commands as I am just learning.

extra infromation:
the 'output' variable will save any output text from the encode, decode, encrypt and decrypt commands and as previously mentioned it will ask if you would like to use this data as an input on any command which requires an input which is not a file name, menu command or key data
